# Exercise Question 4: Class Inheritance

# Create a Bus class that inherits from the Vehicle class.
# Give the capacity argument of Bus.seating_capacity() a default value of 50.

# Use the following code for your parent Vehicle class. You need to use method overriding.


class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, name, max_speed, mileage):
        self.name = name
        self.max_speed = max_speed
        self.mileage = mileage

    def seating_capacity(self, capacity):
        return f"The seating capacity of a {self.name} is {capacity} passengers"


class Bus(Vehicle):
    def seating_capacity(self, capacity=50):
        return super(Bus, self).seating_capacity(capacity=50)


b1 = Bus("School Volvo", 180, 12)
print(b1.seating_capacity())
