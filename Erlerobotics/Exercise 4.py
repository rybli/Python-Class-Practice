# Define a Point3D class that inherits from object Inside the Point3D class,
# define an __init__() function that accepts self, x, y, and z,
# and assigns these numbers to the member variables self.x,self.y,self.z.
#
# Define a __repr__() method that returns "(%d, %d, %d)" % (self.x, self.y, self.z).
# This tells Python to represent this object in the following format: (x, y, z).
#
# Outside the class definition, create a variable named my_point containing
# a new instance of Point3D with x=1, y=2, and z=3. Finally, print my_point.
